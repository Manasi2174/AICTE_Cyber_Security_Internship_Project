<h4>AICTE_Cyber_Security_Internship_Project On.<br>
Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography.</h4>
<p>This project aims to develop a secure and efficient method of data hiding using steganography in images,<br>
  ensuring both data confidentiality and minimal distortion of image.</p>
<p>The project leverages technologies such as Python for implementation, using libraries like OpenCV for image processing, NumPy for numerical operations, and PIL (Pillow) for image handling,<br> 
  alongside cryptographic techniques for added data security.
